    <p>JavaScript (JS) is a scripting language designed to give websites interactive content like menus, animations, interactive maps, scrolling text, and other types of dynamic content. It is a core technology for modern websites, and works side-by-side with HTML and CSS to provide an enjoyable user experience. <br/>Though many daily users are unaware of its role JavaScript plays a fundamental role in the creation and operation of interactive websites, mobile applications, and browser-based games.
    <br/>JavaScript variables can be any of the following:
    <ul>
        <li>Numbers</li>
        <li>Strings</li>
        <li>Arrays</li>
        <li>Functions</li>
        <li>Objects</li>

    <li>Speed, as the language is executed on the user’s device instead of the website’s server. This minimizes server requests, accelerating the user’s experience.</li>
    <li>Reduced server load, as once again the user’s device does most of the heavy lifting, conserving both bandwidth and load. </li>
    <li>Popularity: Nearly every mainstream browser and major online retailer supports JavaScript. Browsers include Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, Internet Explorer, and many others. Online retailers include Amazon, PayPal, Google, and numerous others.</li>
